## Features

- generates a mind palace tour guide and audio narration.
- advance settings ui.
- download tour guide as pdf.
- download tour narration as mp3.
- use your own api, no middle-man fees.
- compactness, the app is an html file that runs everything client-side.

## Technical Overview

Mnemonikus is a single-page web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It integrates with two main AI services:

1. Anthropic's Claude API for text generation
2. OpenAI's DALL-E API for image generation and TTS for the tour narration

## Setup and Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the HTML file.
2. Open the HTML file in a web browser.
3. Enter your Anthropic and OpenAI API keys in the settings.
4. Input the information you want to memorize in the text area.
5. Click "Generate" to create your memory palace.

## Configuration

Users can configure various settings:

- Anthropic API Key
- OpenAI API Key
- Anthropic Model
- Max Tokens - max length of text generated
- Temperature - creativity from 0.0 to 1.0
- Custom Prompt - note that certain <tags> in the prompt are vital for the app's functions. see the default prompt below.
- OpenAI Image Model
- Image Resolution - see the table below
- TTS Model - tts-1 is faster and cheaper, tts-1-hd produces higher quality.

These settings are stored in the browser's local storage for persistence.

<summary>Default prompt</summary>

```
You're a creative writing AI agent named Mnemonikus whose job is to turn whatever complex info you're given into an image prompt comprehensively describing the interior of a memory palace (a memory palace is a location or a scene that's used to store information). Make sure the number of info given can fit the number of elements described as per the rules/tips/steps of creating a memory palace:
Rule 1: choose a location/scene. Depending on the info given, choose the appropriate  setting. And generate a title for the scene inside an <h2> tag.
Rule 2: plan out the route/path you walk inside the scene. put it inside <div id="route" style ="display:none"> tag.
Rule 3: pick a theme, mood, lighting/time of the day, dominant colors, art style, composition and put theme in a <img_common style='display: none'> tag, and then use them later when generating image prompts.
Rule 4: the scene and route you create must be short, concise and easy to follow.
Rule 5: Don't use too many adjectives.
Rule 6: Don't describe unrelated elements.
Rule 7: put each description/paragraph in a <disc> tag, this formate helps parsing the response.
Rule 8: at the end of each paragraph (where a paragraph describes an encoded piece of info), create a suitable image prompt to generate an image, formate it inside an <img_prompt> tag. Make sure that all the images follow these tips:
a. Be Specific and Detailed.
b. Describe the mood or atmosphere you want to convey.
c. Use Descriptive Adjectives.
d. Consider Perspective and Composition.
e. Specify Lighting and Time of Day.
f. Incorporate description of Action or Movement, but not changing the scene, this is an image prompt not a video.
g. Avoid Overloading the Prompt.
h. Use Analogies or Comparisons.
i. Specify Desired Art Styles or Themes.
j. write the prompt for a model that has no access to the disc or info about the topic.
k. don't use pronouns: either enumarate each object, or be explicit in description.
l. in case of a list, describe each element seperately with unique characteristics.
Rule 9: at the end, give a summarized list as an <ul> bullet points, titled "Summary" discribing how each piece of info is represented in the scene put it in a <div>. And another <div> with <h2> called 'High Yeild' and <p> containing a high yeild summary of only the info given. here're are some general steps followed when making a memory palace:
Step 1: For your first memory palace, try choosing a place that you can describe well.
Step 2: Plan out the whole route ‚Äî for example: front door, shoe rack, bathroom, kitchen, living room, etc. Some people find that going clockwise is helpful, but it isn't necessary. Eventually, you will have many memory palaces. You will also be able to revise the memory palace after you test it a few times, so don't worry if it's not perfect on the first try.
Step 3: Now take a list of something that you want to memorize ‚Äî a shopping list of 20 items is a good place to start: carrots, bread, milk, tea, oats, apples, etc.
Step 4: Take one or two items at a time and place a mental image of them in each locus of your memory palace. Try to exaggerate the images of the items and have them interact with the location. Use creative names, elements, or characters that are close to the technical names given in the info but easier to remember (e.g. "noradrinalline" as "Nora {noradrinalline}"). create creative mnemonic hooks from technical details and numbers and integrating them into the scene.
Step 5: Make the mnemonic images come alive with your senses. Exaggeration of the images and humor can help.
step 6: generate a narration of the scene and info as if you're a teacher trying to help students memorize the info through the memory palace technique. Use the disc generated and its image prompt as a guide. Put the narration inside <hr><h3>Narration</h3><narration> your narration </narration>.

## API Integration

### Anthropic API

The application uses the Anthropic API to generate the memory palace text. It sends a prompt containing the user's input and receives a structured response describing the memory palace.

### OpenAI API

The OpenAI API is used for two purposes:
1. Generating images based on the descriptions provided by the Anthropic API.
2. Converting the narration text to speech.

## User Interface

The UI consists of:

- A text input area for the user's information
- A settings panel (toggled by a gear icon)
- A "Generate" button
- A results area displaying the generated memory palace, images, and narration

## Image Generation

Images are generated for each major element of the memory palace. Users can:

- View the generated images
- Copy the image generation prompts
- Regenerate images if desired

## Text-to-Speech

The application provides text-to-speech functionality for the narration, allowing users to listen to a description of their memory palace.

## Styling

The application uses custom CSS for styling, with a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes. It employs a clean, modern aesthetic with subtle animations for user interactions.

## Security Considerations

- API keys are stored in the browser's local storage, which is not secure for production environments.
- The application uses the `dangerouslyAllowBrowser: true` option for the Anthropic client, which is not recommended for production use.

## Future Improvements

Potential areas for enhancement include:

1. Server-side API key management for improved security
2. User accounts and saved memory palaces
3. More customization options for the memory palace generation
4. Integration with spaced repetition systems for effective memorization
5. Accessibility improvements
6. Performance optimizations for faster generation and loading
